# NexusDownloadFlow: Auto-downloader for Nexus Mods

NexusDownloadFlow (NDF) is a program that automates the download process with `Wabbajack modlist installation of Nexus
Mods` in which you have to manually click on `Slow download` button if your Nexus Mods account is not premium.

## How to use NexusDownloadFlow?

### Without Wabbajack

Execute `NexusDownloadFlow.exe` and open your Nexus Mods download page.

### With Wabbajack

Execute `NexusDownloadFlow.exe` while the mod list is downloading.

## Auto-clicker is not clicking

Open an issue [here](https://github.com/greg-ynx/NexusDownloadFlow/issues/new), and if possible, give the scenario in which you had this issue, which version of NDF you are using
and provide a screenshot of your logs or the contents of your current `{date}_ndf.log` file.
